Terraform AWS Multi-Account Setup

This Terraform script facilitates the creation of a VPC peering connection between two VPCs residing in different AWS accounts. Additionally, it constructs public subnets within the second account's VPC. This configuration enables seamless communication between resources across both VPCs, fostering a robust multi-account environment.


Key Features:

VPC Peering Connection: Establishes a VPC peering connection between the VPCs in both accounts, facilitating seamless resource interaction.

Subnet Creation: Creates two public subnets within the second account's VPC, enhancing security and network organization.

Multi-Account Support: Designed to work seamlessly with multi-account setups, ensuring consistent infrastructure across multiple AWS accounts.

Prerequisites:

Terraform installed and configured
AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials for both accounts (IAM role for account2 with necessary permissions)
Familiarity with VPC peering and subnet concepts in AWS
Configuration:

Clone the repository

Modify main.tf to configure VPC details, AWS account information, and any additional desired parameters

Update variables as needed, such as VPC name, CIDR block, and tags

Review the configuration carefully to ensure it aligns with your specific requirements

Usage:

Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform project and download the necessary plugins

Run terraform plan to review the planned changes and verify that the configuration is as intended

Once satisfied with the planned changes, run terraform apply to apply the configuration and create the VPC peering connection and subnets

Example Usage:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


Benefits:

Enhanced Network Connectivity: VPC peering enables efficient communication between resources across both VPCs, simplifying network management and resource interaction.

Improved Security: By isolating public-facing resources to dedicated subnets, the script enhances overall security posture and reduces the attack surface.

Scalable Infrastructure: The script is designed to support multi-account environments, enabling scalable and flexible infrastructure management.

Additional Considerations:

Ensure the IAM role for account2 has the necessary permissions to create VPC peering connections and subnets

Verify that the VPCs in both accounts have compatible CIDR blocks to facilitate communication

Consider using Terraform modules for VPC and subnet creation to further modularize the infrastructure

Implement appropriate security measures, such as network access controls and firewall rules, to protect resources in both VPCs
